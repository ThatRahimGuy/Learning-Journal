Today I'm starting the prototype for FireFist, a 3D platformer where you get from point A to point B in the fastest time possible. I will start by making the third person character movement and animations that I will get from mixamo to use as a base for the prototype but I don't plan to add any enemies to the prototype as I want to focus on character movement with this prototype to get a good grasp on it unless I have extra time.
