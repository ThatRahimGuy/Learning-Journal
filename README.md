Today I'm starting the prototype for FireFist, a 3D platformer where you get from point A to point B in the fastest time possible. I will start by making the third person character movement and animations that I will get from mixamo to use as a base for the prototype but I don't plan to add any enemies to the prototype as I want to focus on character movement with this prototype to get a good grasp on it unless I have extra time.
# Update One
I got stuck on making the character moving forward and backwards as I didn't know how to make a adjacent code that would do the oppoiste of the left and right movement. 
I searched up answers but nothing really helped except for a youtube tutorial by Buvesa Game Development which pushed me in the right direction by showing him replacing vector 3 right with forward.
All I had to was make a new float input and replace the normal input in the code for the forward backward movement with the new input and the vector 3 right with vector 3 forward which fixed the issue. 
Now I'm focus on making the character jump and having a camera follow the character and I think in the downtime between now and next week's lesson I will focus on the mixamo animation by doing research on how to make state machines.
