Today I'm starting the prototype for FireFist, I will start by making the third person character movement and animations that I will get from mixamo to use as a base for the prototype. The game is a 3D platformer where you get from point A to point B but for the prototype I don't plan to add any enemies to it as I want to focus on character movement with this prototype to get a good grasp on it.
